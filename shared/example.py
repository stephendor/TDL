"""Utilities for working with persistence diagrams in TDA.

This module demonstrates documentation standards and provides simple utilities
for handling persistence diagrams, which are fundamental structures in
Topological Data Analysis.

A persistence diagram is a multiset of points in the plane, where each point
(birth, death) represents a topological feature that appears at scale 'birth'
and disappears at scale 'death'.

def filter_by_lifetime(
    diagram: PersistenceDiagram, min_lifetime: float
) -> PersistenceDiagram:
    """Filter persistence diagram by minimum feature lifetime.

    Removes topological features with persistence (death - birth) less than
    the specified threshold. This is useful for filtering noise in TDA analysis.

    Args:
        diagram: Persistence diagram as array of shape (n, 2), where each row
            contains (birth, death) values for a topological feature.
        min_lifetime: Minimum persistence threshold. Features with
            death - birth < min_lifetime will be removed.

    Returns:
        Filtered persistence diagram with the same structure as input,
        containing only features with persistence >= min_lifetime.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If diagram has invalid shape or contains birth > death.
        ValueError: If min_lifetime is negative.

    Examples:
        >>> diagram = np.array([[0.0, 1.0], [0.5, 0.6], [1.0, 3.0]])
        >>> filtered = filter_by_lifetime(diagram, min_lifetime=0.5)

        [[0.  1. ]
         [1.  3. ]]

    Notes:
        The persistence (lifetime) of a feature is defined as death - birth.
        Features on or near the diagonal (birth ≈ death) are typically
        considered topological noise.

        Time complexity: O(n) where n is the number of features.
